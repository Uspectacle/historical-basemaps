# Historical boundaries of world countries and cultural regions

![world 1880 DRAFT ROUGH](img/historicalmaps-leaflet.png)

> "For most of the past 5,000 years, kingdoms and empires were exceptional islands of political hierarchy, surrounded by much larger territories whose inhabitants systematically avoided fixed, overarching systems of authority." - Graeber and Wengrow, 2021, _The Dawn of Everything_

This historical boundaries project aims at providing ready-to-use base maps for mapping historical data. It is __work in progress__: verify the maps by comparison to other sources before using in academic work. If you see errors, report them in the "issues" section.

If you use the maps, think about giving back by [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Apps

Several apps using the historical-basemaps dataset have been developped. A non-exhaustive list:

- [Historic Borders](https://historicborders.app/): a web app with timeline, by Adam (GitHub user @ngrapple).
- [Point in History](https://hanshack.com/point-in-history/): a web app to visualize the history of any point on the planet by Hans Hack.
- A [web app on ourednik.info](https://ourednik.info/historicalmaps/app.html) (aplha release) alows you to exlore the dataset in alternative map projections.

You'll find other [use examples with D3 and Leaflet](https://ourednik.info/historicalmaps/) on ourednik.info.

## GeoJSON

All maps are stored in the [_geojson_](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master/geojson) format: single file per feature layer, human and machine readable, easy to import in [qGIS](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS) or use in [D3](https://github.com/d3) (see [d3v5_example.html](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master/d3v5_example.html) as well as [d3v5_roughjs_example.html](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master/d3v5_roughjs_example.html) with the additional use of [rough.js](https://github.com/pshihn/rough)). [Integration in Leaflet](https://ourednik.info/historicalmaps/leafletExample), OpenLayers et al. is also easy to achieve.

### üìÅ `index.json`

A lightweight summary of the dataset is available in [`index.json`](./index.json). It lists:

* The `year` and corresponding `.geojson` `filename`
* The list of `countries` (based on `NAME` property) in each file

This file is auto-generated on every commit via GitHub Actions and helps applications quickly query available years or filter by country without loading full files.

Example:

```json
{
  "year": 1492,
  "filename": "world_1492.geojson",
  "countries": ["Spain", "Portugal", "Inca Empire"]
}
```

You can regenerate it manually by running:

```bash
node scripts/generateIndex.js
```

### Polygons

Geocoding precision of multipolygons is adapted for mapping data on world/continent scale. The following fields are available in every file:

* __NAME__: the name of the country or region; ideal for text labels
* __SUBJECTO__: the name of the colonial power exercising authority on the country or region; the name of the region otherwise; ideal for choropleth colors
* <span style="color:grey">__PARTOF__: when a region is part of a larger cultural area, e.g. Czechs as part of the Slavic tribes.</span>
* <span style="color:grey">__BORDERPRECISION__ : ordinal values 1 (approximate), 2 (moderately precise) and 3 (determined by international law). Ideal for handling approximate border with blur intensity or other visual effect.</span>

### Points

The file called [_places.geojson_](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master/places.geojson) contains locations of cities and other settlements. For now, it is only a draft and needs your help for completion. Places throughout history can be added to this single file. When used in visualisation software or code, it can be filtered by time fields:

* __name__ {string}: the toponym <span style="color:grey">(it would be great to have this as nested JSON object, [as suggested here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/45330), for places whose toponym changed over time, but this is not yet handled by standard GIS; for now, create distinct points with identical coordinate for each _inhabitedSince_ to _inhabitedUntil_ period)</span>
* __inhabitedSince__ {integer}: inhabited since year
* __inhabitedUntil__ {integer}: inhabited until year, or NULL if it still is.

## SVG

The [maps in the Scalable Vector Graphics format](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master/svg/) are the result of a conversion of GeoJSON files with the R script [_geojson2svg.Rmd_](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps/tree/master/geojson2svg.Rmd). By default, the script uses a "Natural Earth" projection, which can be changed by using another [PROJ string](https://proj.org/operations/projections/) than `natearth2` in `st_transform(geodata, "+proj=natearth2")`.

Please see these SVG files only as raw material editable with a vector drawing software for the needs of GIS-unsavvy users. __If you contribute to this Git repository, please edit directly - and only - the GeoJSON files__.

## Conceptual limitations and disputed territories

When using the data, keep in mind that

1. historical boundaries are even more disputed than contemporary ones, that
2. the actual concept of territory and national boundary becomes meaningful, in Europe, only since the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia) (1648), that
3. areas of civilizations actually overlap, especially in ancient history, and that
4. overlaying these ancient vector maps on contemporary physical maps can be misleading; rivers, lakes, shorelines _do_ change very much over millennia; think for instance about the evolution of the [Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea) since the 1980s.

Overlapping areas are usually dealt with as topological errors in traditional GIS, but some overlaps make sense in the case of this repository. Notwithstanding epistemological and historiographical concerns, the pragmatic bottom line is: vector GIS has points, polygons and lines. That's it. Nevertheless, when __redendering__, _transparent layers_ (opacity < 100%) and _blur effects_ is a convenient way to deal with fuzzy and overlapping borders of pre-modern societies.  

![Fuzzy borders](img/fuzzy-borders.png)

Visual distinction between precise and approximate borders can also be achieved on the same map. See [this D3js example](https://ourednik.info/historicalmaps/d3v5_FuzzyAndExactBorders_example.html).

## Projection

The geodata are stored in the WGS 84 projection, EPSG:4326 (crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84). Coordinates are in LatLon, the projection is geographical. Consider reprojecting to show the maps on world scale, choosing a [projection with minimal area distortion](https://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/ba569633d51ebec6ec6e), such as the __Dymaxion__ (AirOcean) projection or the __Molweide__ projection. 

![world 1880 DRAFT](img/world_1880.png)

Most mapping software and algorithms reproject on the fly. Globe wrapping is also possible, [as illustrates ngrapples's app](https://historicborders.app/?view=globe):
